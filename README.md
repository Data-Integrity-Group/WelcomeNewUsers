# WelcomeNewUsers
Most of the current work is part of an Experimental Development process that is exploring the interactions between a Real and a Virtual (Socercy) author.

The obvious goal is to automate as much of the development process as possible and to resolve apparent issues, such as:

- the need for a common subset of conventions that can co-exist in the various envbironments employed to achieve Best-of-Class performance
  - At this time, these include:
    - GitHub inself (to manage complex interactions among the various development environments),
    - POE as an entry point to a few of the most useful AI tools and as an entry point to the rapidly emerging ones,
    - TiddlyWiki and its platform variants
    - Python as a dominant programming language
    - the aggressive use of UniCode to enhance Information density

- increase the focus on OnTheList ( use headings as HTML anchors ( temporarily ?)
   - suggest ( and assign ) Business Case responsibilitiy
     - provide a loom account to Andrea
       - guide her with a statement of the relative priorities
         - of (just) two Tasks (initially)
     - re-test this at DiigoH
     - immediately after -02-27
       - emphasize that this is slipping ever more due to delays like Loom.
         - always chasing candyland rainbows
           - 0226: loom license now acquired
             - needs verification
  - 0303: this should likely be a separate (external ?)page
    - DiigoH outliner?

## 2025-02:
- Try resurecting this repo
  - perhaps adding LsT reports to PbWorks will help
    - encourage this and see if it can be delegated to a bot - perhaps as a better form of Scrapping
      - this should be tried even if just for a small section
    - Loom and Lz may be informative
      - ask for a training demo - scheduled for -02-17
        - reminded LzT - insisted on a new tine
          - postponed the 09:00 session until 13:00 - then failed to initiate via teams as promised.
      - create a Team/Loom account - this can be a routine Df/account
        - use this as an opportunity for a Corporate card review
          - confirm/Deny the limits management changes at BMO/MC
  - review the CAD/USD product DanS has suggested
    - test exhaustively in order the refine the Banking Operations methodologies we use actively
      - the documentation is now available
